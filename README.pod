Pod::Weaver::Section::Consumes - Add a list of roles to your POD.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your C<weaver.ini>:

    [Consumes]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Pod::Weaver> section plugin creates a "CONSUMES" section in your POD
which will contain a list of all the roles consumed by your class. It accomplishes
this by attempting to compile your class and interrogating its metaclass object.

Classes which do not have a C<meta> method will be skipped.

It rewrites pod only for *.pm files in lib.
